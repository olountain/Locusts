# Before meeting

- [ ] make sure code structure is ok; codes have comments at the top describing what the file is for. 
- [ ] Ideally make sure each file that produces figures names the figures that it creates. 

### During meeting, report on

#### I. Code:

- [x] discuss investigation into unlikely 'comets' found where rproba=1.
- [x] use of dalex package to understand predictor combinations
- [x] tiling 2-d slices of predictors to study patterns at basic level
- [ ] PCA on subsets of predictors (clustered by label) to learn the combinations of predictors associated with labels.
  - not really sure what this tells me...

#### II. Summary:

- [ ] Write a summary of the progress so far, and some figures. It will of necessity be incomplete and cannot be perfect; try anyway.
